The adoption of an \\ninformation security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment \\nand implementation of an organization’s information security management system is influenced by the \\norganization’s needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the \\nsize and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \\nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that \\nrisks are adequately managed.\\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \\norganization’s processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \\nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \\nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\\nThis document can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organization's ability to meet \\nthe organization’s own information security requirements.\\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this document does not reflect their importance \\nor imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference \\npurpose only.\\nISO/IEC\\xa0 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \\nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \\nISO/IEC\\xa027003[2], ISO/IEC\\xa027004[3] and ISO/IEC\\xa027005[4]), with related terms and definitions.\\n\\xa0\\n0.2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Compatibility with other management system standards\\nThis document applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, common terms, \\nand core definitions defined in Annex\\xa0SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part\\xa01, Consolidated ISO Supplement, \\nand therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the \\nAnnex\\xa0SL.\\nThis common approach defined in the Annex\\xa0SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to \\noperate a single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system \\nstandards.\\nv\\n© ISO/IEC 2022 – All rights reserved\\t\\n\\ufeff\\n--``,,,,,``````,,,,,`,`,`,`,,`,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\"),\n",
